# 🚲 Predicting Bike Rentals

<!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a **machine learning model** to predict daily bike rental counts using features such as weather, seasonality, and temporal variables.  

The aim is to apply **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling** in Python to forecast demand for bike rentals.  
Such predictions can help bike-sharing companies improve **fleet management, customer experience, and resource allocation**.

<!-- WORKFLOW -->
## 🔎 Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical features
   - Normalize/scale data

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyze seasonal, weather-based, and temporal trends
   - Correlation heatmaps & visualizations

3. **Model Building**
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R²
   - Compare models for best performance

<!-- RESULTS -->
## 📊 Results & Insights
- Temperature and weather conditions strongly impact rental demand  
- Tree-based models (**Random Forest, Gradient Boosting**) outperformed linear models  
- Trade-off: linear models = easier to interpret, ensemble models = higher accuracy
